# Proffessional Communication Oral Exam 
## Cover Letter

##### Boston College
Responsible Hiring Team  
Boston, United States  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing you in regards to your vacancy on LinkedIn, as it has caught my eye. My name is Zülfikar Kaya, and I am a graduate of HOGENT with a Bachelor's degree in System and Network Administration. I was born and raised in Belgium, but have my ambitions set high as I want to move to the United States and work there.

When I was 6, my sisters were in high school, doing a lot of work on studies, essays, and more. But they never had a safe place to store them. I remember my dad taking courses online on how to host a server in our home and provide tech solutions to his family. And there it started, my love and interest for Networking. It has always amazed me how we could just make our own NAS and share files and large folders between us without connecting to the internet (which was slow at the time). Even though I was 6, I helped him plug all the cables in and tried to think with him on how to troubleshoot the errors we faced. After that, it was always me who was experimenting with servers and other operating systems that we could use. I helped him maintain it for years, and still do. My interest has not only been networking and server management, but I have improved myself on cybersecurity as well. I took courses on how to properly secure a business's servers and other services and I even have applied it to our own homelab.

During my education, I had the opportunity to work in VIC (Virtual IT Company). VIC functions like a company in HOGENT and provides services using Docker, Ansible, Proxmox, Cisco, Active Directory, and others that I have expanded my knowledge on. We had customers whom we worked with, and had the opportunity to analyze and provide them with the matching service they could use for their business. We also had projects which I led on monitoring our servers and backing them up. At my previous role in Jan Palfijn Hospital Gent as IT Support, I had the chance to install and configure a lot of computers for employees and secured them successfully so they could access resources safely from their homes. We also worked with ticketing tools to maximize the efficiency of the hospital and minimize potential downtime, so I am familiar with working with a lot of people. Hence why I would be a great match for your IT team. As I mentioned, I have experience with cybersecurity and would be thrilled to work for a more secure working experience for your employees using IAM and LDAP. I believe all the skills I possess would be a significant addition to your college.

A copy of my résumé has been attached to this letter and will hopefully give you a broad understanding of my skills. Thank you for your valuable time and I look forward to meeting you in person.

Kind regards,  
Zülfikar Kaya

## Argumentative Essay

LLMs, the ultimate society killers?
In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have brought about
transformative changes across numerous fields, particularly with the rise of
generative AI technologies. Capable of creating text, images, music, and more,
generative AI is a tool that many of us have quickly embraced, whether to simply
test its capabilities or to try and use it to solve larger problems and reach more
people with novel solutions. My question to you is, have you ever thought about the
risks of Large Language Models (LLMs)? Or did you ever think about the cost of
using LLMs? Do these technologies destroy our society? Is the earth's climate at
stake? Are we at stake? LLMs tend to have users who particularly don't know the
risks. My opinion, therefore, is that the risks that LLMs provide outweigh the
benefits. Therefore, this paper will enlighten you with the consequences of LLM use.

Building upon these concerns, the big question is, are there any risks of using
LLMs? Unfortunately, we don't live in a utopian world where AI is the best thing
humans created. Like many things, it has a cost. AI-powered applications like the
metaverse likely will have direct consequences on the environment via increased
energy use and thus resource consumption and production of carbon dioxide. In
addition to this, the computing facilities may also have other environmental
impacts, such as the use of water and soil pollution (Mattias C. Rillig, Marlene
Agerstrand, Mohan Bi, Kenneth A. Gould, and Uli Sauerland, 2023). This could
worsen our situation with climate change because of its direct environmental
impacts, which is a hot topic in our society today. Hence why I would like to ask the
question: would you use any LLM after reading this?

Moreover, a more worrying side of the story is the influence humans can have on
the output of LLMs. Bias can be introduced, inadvertently or purposefully, at three
points: the training data, the algorithm, and the form of output. At these three
points, special groups or networks could exploit the ability of LLMs to generate text
with unprecedented efficiency, thus offering misinformation under the guise of AI.
This could bring biased answers, which include environmental racism, climate
change, biodiversity loss, and more (Mattias C. Rillig, Marlene Agerstrand, Mohan Bi,
Kenneth A. Gould, and Uli Sauerland, 2023). In other terms, without moderation for
bias or inefficient use, this could be catastrophic for our future. Risks include
cultural divide, worsened climate change, and reduced nature experience. The
benefits could be life-changing, but the cost is too much. A bad deal, in short.

Furthermore, the economic implications of widespread LLM adoption cannot be
ignored. As these systems are being used by various industries, there's a real risk of
layoffs and economic fallouts. While some argue that AI will create new jobs, the
fast growth of LLM development might lessen our ability to change our workforce.
Small businesses and developing economies might find themselves at a
disadvantage, unable to compete with larger corporations that can afford to
implement these expensive technologies, potentially widening the global economic
divide (Goldman Sachs, 2023; World Economic Forum, 2023).

In conclusion, while LLMs represent a great technological achievement, their
environmental impact and chance for abuse pose risks to our society. The
combination of high energy consumption, environmental risks, and the possibility
of biased or manipulated outputs makes these systems look like an angel who has
devilish thoughts. Unless we find sustainable solutions and implement strict
controls on their development and use, the price we pay for this technology might
be far greater than any benefits we receive. It's important for users and developers
to carefully consider learning more about the dark side of LLMs before further
expanding the role of LLMs in our daily lives.

## Idea Pitch: The Need for Ethics in IT

### The Problem
As technology continues to advance, we face growing ethical dilemmas—privacy violations, algorithmic bias, and cybersecurity risks are just a few examples. Too often, the focus on innovation and profits overshadows the potential harm these technologies can cause. Whether it’s AI making biased decisions or data breaches exposing personal information, the absence of ethics in IT is a growing threat to individuals, businesses, and society.

### The Solution
What we need is a unified ethical framework for IT—one that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and fairness. By making ethics a foundational part of every tech decision, we can ensure that the innovations we build are responsible and inclusive. This framework would guide developers and companies in creating technologies that benefit society while mitigating risks.

### Why Now
Technology is more powerful than ever, and the decisions we make today will shape the future. If we fail to prioritize ethics, we risk creating systems that deepen inequalities, invade privacy, and undermine trust. But by integrating ethics into IT now, we can steer innovation in a direction that serves everyone, not just a few.

### The Impact
- **For businesses:** Ethical practices foster trust and loyalty, enhancing brand reputation and customer satisfaction.
- **For developers:** Clear ethical guidelines empower professionals to make responsible decisions in complex situations.
- **For society:** Ethics in IT leads to technologies that are fair, inclusive, and secure—ensuring a better, more equitable future.

### Call to Action
Now is the time to act. Let’s champion ethics in IT and build a future where technology benefits everyone. It’s not just about creating smarter systems; it’s about creating responsible systems that work for humanity.

Thank you.

## Informative PowerPoint

### Slide 1
**Hook:** Imagine a world where your internet service provider dictates your online experience, favoring certain content over others. This is the world without net neutrality.

**Content:**
- **Equality of Access:** Net neutrality ensures that smaller startups and individual content creators have the same opportunities as larger corporations to reach their audience.
- **Freedom of Expression:** It prevents ISPs from censoring or slowing down content they disagree with, safeguarding free speech online.
- **Innovation:** A neutral internet fosters an environment where new ideas and technologies can flourish without being stifled by ISP gatekeeping.

### Slide 2
**Content:**
- The European Union has been a pioneer in enacting net neutrality laws. The key regulation is the *Open Internet Regulation*, which came into effect in 2016. This regulation prohibits ISPs from blocking, throttling, or offering paid prioritization of internet traffic, with limited exceptions for network management and specialized services.
- **Implementation and Enforcement:** The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) was tasked with providing guidelines for the implementation of the regulation, which were updated in 2020 to address new challenges and technologies.
- **Challenges and Controversies:** Despite the strong regulatory framework, there have been instances where ISPs have attempted to circumvent these rules, leading to ongoing debates and legal battles over what constitutes a violation of net neutrality.

### Slide 3
**Content:**
- **Current State and Future Outlook:**
  - **Compliance and Monitoring:** The European Commission and national regulatory authorities continue to monitor ISP compliance with net neutrality rules, with periodic reports and assessments.
  - **Evolving Technology:** The rise of AI and other advanced technologies presents new challenges for net neutrality, as regulators must ensure that these innovations do not undermine the principles of an open internet.
  - **Global Influence:** The EU's approach to net neutrality has influenced other regions, setting a benchmark for internet governance worldwide.

### Conclusion
Net neutrality remains a cornerstone of a free and open internet. The European Union's proactive stance has set a high standard for protecting this principle. As technology evolves, it is crucial for regulators, ISPs, and internet users to remain vigilant and engaged to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field for all.
